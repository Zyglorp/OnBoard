# USPico Hub

It's a USB Hub combined with a Raspberry Pi Pico for networking use. It has USB-A ports and a USB-A port to plug in to an outlet or a computer.

It costs around $98.66 total, with all components.

The wire routing was somewhat hard because of the crossing and interweaving, but I managed to handle it in the end.
